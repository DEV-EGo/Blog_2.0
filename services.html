                        We have also helped thousands of immigrants obtain their lawful permanent resident status and
                        naturalization in the United States. We have successfully represented hundreds of clients in
                        deportation or removal proceedings and obtained the lawful permanent residence of many who were
                        on the verge of being deported from the United States. Our experienced attorneys have also
                        represented thousands of clients in criminal courts for all kings of criminal charges. Although
                        it is not possible to obtain a dismissal in every case, our experienced attorneys often obtain
                        the quick release from jail and negotiate with prosecutors and arrange for reduced charges or
                        sentencing. We are committed to defending our clients’ rights regardless of their economic
                        situation or legal status.

                        We offer free initial consultations with a contingency-basis fee structure for all injury cases.
                        This means you will have no legal fees to pay unless we recover a compensation for you. We
                        believe in helping injured people, and we work thoroughly and consistently to do what it takes
                        to help you get a fair and just result. Your accident deserves a thorough investigation. Even if
                        you are not sure you have a claim, we can provide you with a thorough analysis at no cost. We
                        fight to obtain the best compensation for our clients, and we keep our clients well informed
                        during the entire claim process and especially if litigation is needed.
